After I give my answer, the next natural question is "where do PhD students from your department usually go after they graduate?" This question also comes up every year when prospective students visit our department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, my answer to that second question was that 1/3rd of our graduates went to academia, 1/3rd went into industry, and roughly 1/3rd went into what could loosely be defined as "other," which are jobs that are not quite academia but also not industry either, such as those at a national lab, a government agency, or a think tank like the RAND Corporation. This was more of a guess than anything based on real data, mostly because while we do have a webpage with where our alumni go after they graduate (&lt;a href="http://stat.psu.edu/alumni"&gt;http://stat.psu.edu/alumni&lt;/a&gt;), that information is not in a format that's easily analyzable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, I do actually want the answer to this question. Part of this is so that I can actually give a good answer to prospective students (or other people who are curious), and part of it is just to satisfy my own curiosity. I recently spent some time organizing the available data into a more manageable CSV file so that I can finally answer the question of where Penn State statistics PhD graduates go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the data was taken off of the website link above for graduates from 2010 until 2018. I chose to cutoff at 2018 because 2019 graduate information isn't yet fully available and because data before 2010 seems more incomplete. Additionally, data from more than 9 years ago might not be so representative of recent trends in our department. Overall, this meant that I had information on 94 graduates and the first jobs and institutions they went to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will note as a major caveat that this information is self reported. While I think the information provided is accurate, it is possible that there is some kind of bias with who actually fills out this form. All of the data as well as the RMarkdown file (with the R code) can be found here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/yazhao/PSUPhdGrads"&gt;https://github.com/yazhao/PSUPhdGrads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this analysis, I looked only at the first job taken by graduates right after they got their PhD. It's entirely possible that many of these people switched career tracks, but tracking down that full information proved to be difficult. Additionally, I'm mostly interested in where people are &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; placed, not necessarily where they ultimately end up. I wanted to see what the immediate next step of a Penn State statistics PhD would be. The three categories of jobs were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academia&lt;/strong&gt;: This includes any job working at an academic institution like a university. It also included any first job where the title was postdoc. This was an overly broad definition, and so I included people who weren't strictly on a tenure-track assistant professorship, but rather anyone who got a job in an academic setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;: Anyone who went to work at a private company was put into this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other&lt;/strong&gt;: This included jobs and institutions that weren't necessarily academia but also clearly were not industry. In this category included working at a government agency, a national lab, and non-profit think tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cases where I didn't have a first job title, I used the first job location to define the job type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;## &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;## Academia Industry    Other &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;##    61.70    30.85     7.45&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="center" src="/figure/psu-phd-graduates-firstjobs/summary-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the past 9 years worth of data, it seems that by and large our PhD graduates go into academia. Over 60 percent of our graduates end up in academia with their first job, a little over 30 percent go into private industry, while only about 7.5 percent go into that Other category. It seems that my initial impressions (and the answer I've been giving people) were wrong. And while these numbers might be inflated due to my broad definition of an academic job, it seems that our department largely prepares people for academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was curious to see if the trends behind these first jobs had changed over the time of the dataset. Was this pattern of mostly academic jobs relatively consistent, or have there been changes in the composition of jobs over time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="trends raw numbers line graph" src="/figure/psu-phd-graduates-firstjobs/trends-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="trends percentage line graph" src="/figure/psu-phd-graduates-firstjobs/trends-2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like there has definitely been changes in the category compositions over time. Initially, basically all graduates went into academia. However, around 2013, that trend started shifting, as a more even number of students went into industry. That trend reversed in 2016, though that change was mostly because of people going into the Other category. Last year was the first one in recent memory where more people went into industry than academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intuition that our department was roughly evenly split among the three types of jobs for graduates was obviously incorrect. Based on historical data, that split is closer to 60/30/10 for academia/industry/other. In recent years, however, that trend has been changing. I think it's fair to say that roughly 55-65 percent of our department's graduates go into academia, with the balance (35-45 percent) going into industry or some other type of job. This gives a much different picture of my department than I initially believed, one that (for obvious reasons) is more focused on training people for academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this kind of analysis has a lot of caveats. It's possible that people going into industry might not be as interested in filling out this information, or people going into jobs that they don't particularly like. It's also possible that a lot of the people who first get an academic job (notably, many of those who are lecturers or postdocs) might end up switching tracks and going into industry or some other type of job, while the reverse trend might be much less common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this information does indicate that Penn State's statistics department does primarily focus on putting students into academic jobs. In any case, at least now I have a more accurate answer to the question of "Where do Penn State statistics PhD students go after they graduate?" the next time somebody asks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="rmd_output"></category><category term="statistics"></category><category term="eda"></category><category term="jobs"></category><category term="pennstate"></category></entry><entry><title>The Unroll.me Data That Uber Bought Probably Isn't That Anonymous</title><link href="https://www.alex-zhao.com/2017/04/25/uber-unrollme-not-anon/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-25T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-01-12T22:44:54-05:00</updated><author><name>Alex Zhao</name></author><id>tag:www.alex-zhao.com,2017-04-25:/2017/04/25/uber-unrollme-not-anon/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As was to be expected, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/technology/travis-kalanick-pushes-uber-and-himself-to-the-precipice.html"&gt;New York Times article about Uber&lt;/a&gt; has gotten the internet into an uproar over how Uber conducts its business.

What's strange, however, is that while much of the internet's displeasure has been focused on Uber (and reading the article points out several aggressive and probably borderline unethical actions by the company), the biggest casualty from this story might not be Uber at all. Instead, another company, Slice Technologies, owner of a popular inbox decluttering service &lt;a href="https://unroll.me/"&gt;Unroll.me&lt;/a&gt;, was revealed to have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/technology/personal-data-firm-slice-unroll-me-backlash-uber.html"&gt;sold receipt data&lt;/a&gt; from Uber's competitor Lyft to Uber, in a supposedly anonymized fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally don't think that Slice's particular defenses (we told you we do this and everyone else does it) are particularly compelling. The former depends on a Terms of Service no human being is actually reading, and the latter isn't quite true: the closest analogy I have seen would be Google mining its own data (in its apps and services) to monitor employees of competitors like Apple and Facebook. But that is an issue for another day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My problem with this whole saga is the fact that &lt;strong&gt;the information Slice sold really isn't that anonymous&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Location data might be enough&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's suppose for a second that Slice did what it thought was due diligence and removed the names from every receipt. From the articles that I've read, that is essentially the extent to which the data was anonymized and sold to Uber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unroll.me, a free service to unsubscribe from email lists, can scour people’s inboxes for receipts from services like Lyft and then sell the information to companies like Uber. The data is anonymized, meaning individuals’ names are not attached to the information, and can be used as a proxy for the health of a rival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's possible that Slice also protected some of the location data, but a) that's very much unclear from its own &lt;a href="https://www.slice.com/privacy"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, and b) If they sold receipt-level data, it's possible both that Uber wanted that location data to keep track of Lyft and that the data is there anyways. At the very least, nothing in Slice's privacy policy prohibits this, and it's very likely they make as much of the individual receipt-level information available as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a problem, since a Lyft receipt looks like this:
&lt;img alt="Lyft Receipt" src="https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204568237/unnamed.png" title="Lyft Receipt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the reporting around these data sales is true, then what we assume is that all of the information in the receipt above, sans the customer's name, were sold to Uber. That means the last 4 of the credit card, the pickup, and the dropoff, would all be information that Uber could effectively parse. In the abstract, missing the names might be an effective method for eliminating personally identifiable information that would allow someone to trace individual trips back to an actual person. That is to say, this it's difficult to take that kind of receipt data and expose individual identities from just that database alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem is that Uber has another pretty much identical database which can be used to reveal these receipt-level identities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to take "anonymous" data and find identities if you're Uber&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take your own users' data, specifically any saved addresses (for example for Home or Work)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to this, find for each user their most commonly used addresses/GPS coordinate region (say, within 50 feet) both for pickup and dropoff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the Slice data exists also at the user level, do the same thing for receipts you get for each distinct customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Slice gives you the last 4 of the credit cards for each receipts, compare those with your internal data as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the information from steps 1-4 (and information about when rides were requested as well) to match up users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you have information on which of your Uber riders use Lyft, and their names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, of course, many caveats to this process. For starters, it's not very well defined since the objective here was not to fully flesh out the exact process by which to match up this supposedly anonymous data with Uber's own data, but rather to point out the general direction by which it could be done. It's also possible that Slice Technologies is better about data privacy than the articles claim, since they might simply aggregate data up at a level that makes it harder to tell who individual users are. Moreover, it's possible that Slice neither provided nor Uber requested that level of granularity, though I am more skeptical about the latter case and nothing within Slice's privacy policy actually rules that out (and indeed reserves the right to sell email messages). And finally, even given all this information, you probably can't get a 100% match between Lyft and Uber users (though very good rates are not out of the question).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Do a better job of protecting user privacy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the biggest problem was simply the claim that removing people's names from this receipt level data was sufficient to anonymize the information. Perhaps in the abstract this is true, but when everything else about the receipt information is available, it's not that hard to figure out a name. Indeed, Uber would be far from the only company that could do this: any e-commerce business that stores addresses or tracks locations could use this level of data to find the identities of Lyft users. Given all of the potential touchpoints available from these receipts (and other touchpoints Slice has, including but not limited to device IDs, geographical location, times of purchase, amount of purchase, and last 4 of the credit card), to call this data anonymous simply because names were removed is simply wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data and databases don't exist simply in the abstract. When considering how to securely release or anonymize your data, not accounting for the data that the party you're selling to might have is one surefire way to leak data you didn't want to reveal in the first place. At the very least, companies should be revealing as little data as possible to third parties if they truly care about protecting user privacy. Barring that, aggregating the data or adding random noise to the user-level data is imperative if you actually care about obscuring personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if you haven't already, you should probably delete your Unroll.me account.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markdown"></category><category term="technology"></category><category term="startups"></category><category term="data privacy"></category></entry></feed>

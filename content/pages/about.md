Title: About

I'm a PhD student in [statistics](http://stat.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University, with interests in machine learning, high-dimensional inference and regression.

Before starting graduate school I worked as a data analyst at both [Zynga](https://www.zynga.com/) and [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com/). I completed my BA in economics with a minor in statistics at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/), where I was a member of the [Chicago Debate Society](http://debate.uchicago.edu/).

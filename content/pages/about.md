Title: About

I'm a graduate student in  the [statistics department](http://stat.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University in my first year of study.

Before starting graduate school I worked as a data analyst at both [Zynga](https://www.zynga.com/) and [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com/). Prior to that, I was an undergraduate economics student at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/), where I was a member of the [Chicago Debate Society](http://debate.uchicago.edu/).

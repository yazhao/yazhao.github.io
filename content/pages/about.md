Title: About

I'm a third year graduate student in the [statistics department](http://stat.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University, interesting in machine learning and classification problems.

Before starting graduate school I worked as a data analyst at both [Zynga](https://www.zynga.com/) and [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com/). Prior to that, I was an undergraduate economics student at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu/), where I was a member of the [Chicago Debate Society](http://debate.uchicago.edu/).

Title: About

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics](https://science.psu.edu/stat) at Penn State University, with research interests in high-dimensional regression, inference, and machine learning.

Prior to starting graduate school I worked for four years in data analytics, first at [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com/) and most recently at [Zynga](https://www.zynga.com/). I completed my BA in Economics with a minor in statistics at the University of Chicago.
